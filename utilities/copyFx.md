This is alias will copy an effect from one combatant to another, including automations such as buttons and actions.  

**Usage:**
`!copyFx -c <source> -fx <effect> -t <target 1> -t <target 2> [debug]`

`     -c` Copy from Combatant
`     -t` Apply to Combatant(s)
`    -fx` Effect name we are copying (partials accepted)
`  debug` Display debug information

Use this to spread an effect to a combatant as they enter a spell effect area. No need to recast a spell.
